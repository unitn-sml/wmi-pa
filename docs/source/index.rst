**WM\*PY** (``wmpy``) is a modular library for solving quantitative
 reasoning tasks over logical and algebraic constraints.

Our goals:

* Facilitating the integration of state-of-the-art WM* technology into your project
* Providing a flexible framework for the development of novel solvers

**Unfamiliar with WMI or SMT?** :ref:`Read <theory>` our theory primer first.

**Eager to code?** :ref:`Get started <getstarted>` now!

**Curious about advanced use cases?** :ref:`Check out <tutorials>` our Jupiter notebooks.

**Want to be part of** ``wmpy`` **?** :ref:`Learn <development>` how to contribute.
